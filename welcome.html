                <p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

                    We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

                    The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

                    Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

                    <p>Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.

                If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

                We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

                The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

                Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

                What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

                Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

                We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

                If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

                To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</p>
